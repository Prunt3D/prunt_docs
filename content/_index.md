Prunt is an advanced open-source motion control system targetted at 3D printers.
Prunt includes features not found in other popular open-source systems, including:

- Corner blending with user defined deviation.
- Constrained and independently adjustable velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, and crackle.
- Pinout data provided by the board to eliminate the need to edit pin mappings in a configuration file.
- Built-in GUI for configuration editing without the need to ever edit configuration files directly.

We also sell our own hardware with features not present on most consumer 3D printing hardware:

- Fully isolated USB to protect upstream devices.
- Reverse polarity protection.
- Protection against electrical shorts to 24V on most exposed pins.
- Individual hardware timers for every stepper, allowing for precise step timings.
- Support for 2-pin and 4-pin fans on the same ports.
- Fail-safe firmware updates, eliminating the need to ever install a jumper.
- Hardware counters for high speed fan tachometers.
- Soft-start to allow a wider range of power supplies.
- PT1000 support without jumpers.
